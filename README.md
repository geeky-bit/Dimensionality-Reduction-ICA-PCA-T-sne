# Massive Guide to Dimensionality-Reduction
This repos is a collection of examples of various Dimensionality Reduction techniques
I will try to cover almost all currently used techniques.
If you are new, don't worry. Codes will in *Python and R*. **Cheers !!!**

#### Methods based on Statistics and Information Theory
* Vector Quantization and Mixture models(K-means)
* Generative Topic Moedlling
* Self Organizing Maps
* Elastic Maps and Nets, Principal Graphs and Principal Trees
* Kernel PCA and Multidimensional Scaling
* Kernel Entropy Component Analysis
* Robust PCA
* Factor Analysis
* ICA
* T-SNE

#### Methods based on Dictionaries

*Another family of methods is based on the decomposition of a matrix formed by all input data as columns, X .
The input data matrix using the input variables is transformed into a new data matrix using the new variables. The
transformation is nothing but a linear change of basis between the two variable sets. I will cover some of them.*

**Stay tuned. I have just started uploading the codes. In the next couple of days, I will upload all the codes with examples and some visualizations.**
